Building

SCC can be built and run on x86_64_linux and arm64_linux.

To build SCC, run "./build.sh <build_platform> <host_platform> <target_platform>".
The generated compilers will be in the "release_*" directory.


Note

SCC uses a C-like syntax, but it is not fully compatible with standard C.

Many assembly instructions are not supported. If you want to add supports
for specific assembly instructions, please modify the
"platform_PLATFORM/asm/ins/ins.c" file.

On Linux, SCC does not support dynamic linking.


Usage

To compile a source file using SCC, use the following commands:

> scpp source.c tmp.i
> scc tmp.i tmp.asm
> asm tmp.asm executable debug.asmmap

The "debug.asmmap" argument is optional.
